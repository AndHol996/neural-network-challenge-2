# neural-network-challenge-2
***
## Description
This program explores the use of machine learning through neural networks. It uses the features in the provided dataset to create two models that can predict the likelihood of an employee leaving and predict the department that best fits an employee. 

## Project Status
The code is at a stable state. May revise the code in order to further understand supervised machine learning models.

## Conditions
The specifications for this program is that it is running on Python 3.10.14 for a Conda environment and imported pandas, layers and Model from tensorflow, train_test_split, StandardScaler, and OneHotEncoder from scikit-learn, and numpy.
